# Suomi.fi -maps

Suomi.fi-maps is part of Finnish national e-services for public sector organisations. With Suomi.fi-maps municipalities and other public sector organisations can create and publish embedded maps to their own web-sites for either internal or public use.

# How is Oskari used?

Service includes ready-to-use tools for easy web maps, and a variety of geospatial datasets, including topographic maps and background maps. A wide range of geospatial datasets produced by other public authorities are also available at the service. 

With RPC the user is able to configure more customized map services if needed. 

The service is provided and developed by the National Land Survey of Finland. Suomi.fi-maps is based on Oskari and uses most of the Oskari core possibilities. Today, nearly all the code that is developed for Suomi.fi-maps by the team in National Land Survey is adopted in Oskari and made open for anybody else to use. Whenever a new Oskari version is released, it will soon be updated to the Suomi.fi-maps. 

In developing and maintaining the Suomi.fi-maps our greatest interest is making sure the long term continuity of the product is secured. This requires maintaining a good level of performance, ensuring that the increasing use and map layers won't get the  updating libraries Oskari depends on, 

In the past couple of years we developed or improved e.g. the following functionalities in the Oskari frontend: 

## Who is the map service for?

Some of the better known use cases of Suomi.fi-maps embedded maps and RPC use are the Map Site hosted by the National Land Survey and the fishing related (and other) map services hosted by the Food Authority.
